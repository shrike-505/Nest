+ "Fast" Ethernet operates 10x faster (100Mbps) than regular ethernet. Explain why the following changes were made.
  + Encoding changed to 4B/5B. 
  + CAT-5 cable has more twists.

+ If a binary signal is sent over a 3-kHz channel whose signal-to-noise radio is 20dB, what is the maximum achievable data rate?

+ What are the advantages of fiber optics over copper as a transmission medium? Is there any downside of using fiber optics over copper?

+ Is the Nyquist theorem true for high-quality single-mode optical fiber or only for copper wire?

+ What is the minimum bandwidth needed to achieve a data rate of B bits/sec if the  signal is transmitted using NRZ and Manchester encoding? Explain your answer.

+ Is an oil pipeline a simplex system, a half-duplex system, a full-duplex system, or none of the above? What about a river or a walkie-talkie-style communication?

+ A modem constellation diagram similar to Fig. 2-17(a) has data points at the following coordinates: (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1). How many bps can a modem with these parameters achieve at 1200 symbols/sec?

+ What is the difference, if any, between the demodulator part of a modem and the coder part of codec? (After all, both convert analog signals to digital ones.)

+ Suppose that A, B, and C are simultaneously transmitting 0 bits, using a CDMA  system with the chip sequences of Fig.(a). What is the resulting chip sequence?
