Professor: Today we’re going to talk about the debate between economic growth and protecting the environment. Economic growth creates new jobs and gives people money they can use to improve their lives. On the other hand, if we protect the environment it can be enjoyed both by ourselves and future generations. If you had to choose between prioritizing economic growth or protecting the environment, which one would you choose.  Why?

Alex: I would prioritize the environment. We only have one planet and if we don’t take care of it, we won’t have pleasant lives in the future. Economic growth can be important, but not at the expense of the environment. I think we need to shift towards more things such as investing in renewable energy and promoting environmentally-friendly technologies.  We’ll all live much healthier lives if the world around us is clean.

Maggie: While I agree with Alex that environmental sustainability is important, I think that economic growth is the only way to solve many of the social and economic problems we face. We need a strong economy to create jobs, reduce poverty, and improve standards of living.  Not only that, but when companies grow stronger and more profitable, they can develop new technologies that solve our environmental problems.

Ans: While I highly appreciate Alex's opinion that environment protection should be prioritized, I advocate the point made by Maggie that economy growth plays an important role. First, the growth in economy grants a feeling of well-being among civilizations. Remember that a healthy economic situation allows all of us to make enough money with a regular income to make a living. Some people may argue that solely focusing on economy growth will definitely lead to more severe environmental problems such as pollutions and global warming, but I tend to disagree. The environment will be protected more effectively and thoroughly due to the emerge of new technologies spurred by economy growth.

Paradigm: While I respect Alex's view that we should prioritize environmental protection, I strongly agree with Maggie that economic growth **deserves higher priority when the two goals conflict**. First, a robust economy provides people with stable jobs and rising incomes, which directly improves their quality of life. When individuals and families have financial security, they experience greater well-being and can better plan for the future—something that is difficult in a stagnant or shrinking economy. Some may argue that rapid economic growth **inevitably** causes severe environmental damage, such as air and water pollution or global warming. However, I believe **the opposite is true in the long run**. Economic growth generates the wealth and profit that fund technological innovation. For example, the rapid development of renewable energy—solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles like those produced by Tesla—has been driven primarily by profitable companies and wealthy economies. Countries such as Germany and Denmark have achieved strong economic performance while becoming global leaders in clean energy, proving that growth can **actually accelerate environmental solutions rather than hinder them**. In short, without a strong economy, we lack the resources to develop and deploy the very technologies needed to protect our planet effectively.

Professor:  A new story about Artificial Intelligence (AI) is in the news almost every day.  And, of course, companies are spending an enormous amount of money to develop new technologies related to AI.  Before next class, I want you to consider the following question: Is AI a dangerous technology that, overall, will be harmful to society, or is it a powerful tool that will improve the lives of people?

Megan: Personally, I think AI is a threat. As AI advances, many jobs may become automated, leaving people without work. That will certainly increase income inequality. Additionally, there’s the risk that AI systems could be programmed with biases or used to discriminate against certain groups. We need to be careful and ensure that AI is developed in an ethical and responsible way.  Since we can’t guarantee that right now, I think it is best to slow down.

David: I disagree with Megan. I’m of the opinion that AI has the potential to solve many of the world’s problems, from climate change to disease. Additionally, AI can help us make better decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that humans may miss. That said, I agree with Megan that we must ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible way that benefits society as a whole.

Ans: Megan presents a compelling view that AI is a threat. Admittedly, if not developed and researched in a safe way, AI will cause severe upheavel in the job market and society. However, I am inclined to agree with David's argument that AI may be a solution to many worldwide problems. In my view, due to its unprecented capability to analyse large amount of data, AI is able to make highly valued predictions in many fields. The predictions will be more precise compared with those made by humans in the past, the latter using only personal experiences and expectations. For example, for those who work in financial departments and deal with economic problems, they can utilize AI to make a better prediction toward the situation of finance. Therefore, I firmly believe that AI will be a useful tool for tackling the problems faced by all people.
