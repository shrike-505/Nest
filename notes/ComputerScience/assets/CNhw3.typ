1. A bit string, 0111101111101111110, needs to be transmitted at the data link layer. What is the string actually transmitted after bit stuffing?

  Insert a 0 after every consecutive 1s: 011110111110011111010

2. What is the remainder obtained by dividing $x^7 + x^5 + 1$ by the generator polynomial $x^3 + 1$? (give your answer as bit string)

  Get remainder $-x^2 + x + 1$, correspond to bit string 111

3. A channel has a bit rate of 4 kbps and a propagation delay of 20 msec. For what range of frame sizes does stop-and-wait give an efficiency of at least 50 percent? 
   
  $50% = frac()$
